# Roland TR-909 Firmware Analysis

An attempt to reverse engineer the TR-909 from the binary files that are available on the web.

Focusing on V4, but with V1 as a cross reference.  Haven't found 2 or 3 (or 0?) on the web.

Disassembled using the UNIDASM that comes bundled with some version of MAME (_though not in the one apt put on my Ubuntu machine?_).
